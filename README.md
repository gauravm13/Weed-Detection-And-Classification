# Weed-Detection-And-Classification
This project focuses on detecting and classifying weeds using Machine Learning and Computer Vision. It helps farmers identify unwanted plants in crop fields and enables efficient weed control.

 # Features

Detects weeds from images.

Classifies between crops and weeds.

Supports real-time inference with ESP32 for connectivity.

Simple dashboard for results visualization.

# Tech Stack

Machine Learning: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda Navigator)

Hardware: ESP32 for connectivity and control

Optional: React.js (frontend) 

# Dataset

Dataset of crops and weeds collected from open Kaggle.


# How It Works

Open Jupyter Notebook and run the preprocessing + training notebooks.

Train ML model (CNN/Transfer Learning).

Test on sample images to classify as crop or weed.

Save trained model (.h5 or .pkl) for deployment.

(Optional) Connect with ESP32 and frontend dashboard for real-time monitoring.

# Future Scope

Larger and more diverse datasets.

Real-time weed removal robot integration.

Mobile app version.
